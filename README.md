# Alabaster Industries Alternative

This application is an alternative site to alabaster.industries. It is a multi-page CRUD app made using Express and NodeJS. It is styled different to the original website but has added features for the administrators to post/edit and delete products. It also has a sign-up feature for new users to view the site. The site was designed in a way that it would be a permium, invite-only site, thus the site's layout and design.

To view CRUD utilities, please log into the website with username: 'admin' and password: 'root'.
